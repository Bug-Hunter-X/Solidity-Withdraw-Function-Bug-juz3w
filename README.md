# Solidity Smart Contract Bug: Incorrect Withdraw Function

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Solidity smart contracts related to the order of operations in a withdrawal function.  The `withdraw` function incorrectly sets the balance to zero *before* attempting the transfer.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and failures if another function is called between reading the balance and initiating the transfer.

## Bug Description

The `withdraw` function in `bug.sol` reads the user's balance, checks for sufficiency, and then *immediately* sets the balance to zero.  Only *after* this does it attempt to transfer the funds using `msg.sender.call{value: amount}(new bytes(0))`.  If anything else modifies the contract's state, even slightly, between these two operations, the transfer may fail due to an insufficient balance (because the balance was already zeroed out). 

## Solution

The corrected code in `bugSolution.sol` addresses this issue by performing the transfer first and then updating the balance. This ensures that the balance is correctly updated after the transfer is successful.

## How to Reproduce

1. Compile both `bug.sol` and `bugSolution.sol` using a Solidity compiler.
2. Deploy both contracts to a test network.
3. Attempt to withdraw funds using both contracts. You'll likely see a failure with the original buggy contract in many cases.
